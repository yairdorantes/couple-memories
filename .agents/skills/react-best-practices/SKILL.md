# React Best Practices

## Overview

Routing and priority guide for React performance and quality, containing 26 rules across 9 categories. Rule files hold the detailed explanations, examples, review smells, and impact metrics.

## When to Apply

Reference these guidelines when:

- Writing new React components
- Implementing data fetching
- Reviewing code for performance issues
- Refactoring existing React code
- Optimizing bundle size or load times

## Priority-Ordered Guidelines

Rules are prioritized by impact:

| Priority | Category                  | Impact                        |
| -------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| 1        | Eliminating Waterfalls    | CRITICAL                      |
| 2        | Bundle Size Optimization  | CRITICAL                      |
| 3        | Client-Side Data Fetching | MEDIUM-HIGH                   |
| 4        | Re-render Optimization    | MEDIUM                        |
| 5        | Rendering Performance     | MEDIUM                        |
| 6        | JavaScript Performance    | LOW-MEDIUM                    |
| 7        | Component Structure       | MEDIUM-HIGH (maintainability) |
| 8        | Testing                   | MEDIUM-HIGH (correctness)     |
| 9        | Type Safety               | HIGH                          |

## Quick Reference

### Critical Patterns (Apply First)

**Eliminate Waterfalls:**

- Use `Promise.all()` for independent async operations (`async-parallel`)

**Reduce Bundle Size:**

- Avoid barrel file imports, import directly from source (`bundle-barrel-imports`)
- Defer non-critical third-party libraries (`bundle-defer-third-party`)

### Medium-Impact Patterns

**Client-Side Data Fetching:**

- Use Tanstack Query for automatic request deduplication (`client-request-dedupe`)
- Dependent query params are the value or `undefined`, never `| null` or a fake fallback; narrow at the caller so hooks stay strict, or guard with `skipToken` when the hook must accept an optional param (`client-request-dedupe`)

**Re-render Optimization:**

- Use lazy state initialization for expensive values (`rerender-lazy-state-init`)
- Apply `startTransition` for non-urgent updates (`rerender-transitions`)
- Keep UI handlers plain; use Effect Events only for effect-fired logic (`rerender-useeffect-function-calls`)
- Never reset state with `useEffect`; lift the discriminant and remount the branch (`rerender-no-useeffect-state-reset`)
- Never add `useMemo` or `useCallback`; leave memoization decisions to developers with profiler evidence (`rerender-no-usememo-usecallback`)
- Never call `setState` during render or inside `useEffect`; derive during render or move state ownership to an intermediate component (`rerender-no-setstate-in-render-or-effect`)

**Component Structure:**

- One domain component/hook per file, one responsibility each — split bloated components (`structure-single-responsibility`)
- Keep component, hook, function, and utility APIs narrow: split oversized props, arguments, and return objects into focused units composed at the component level; wrapping the same values in one object is not a fix (`structure-narrow-apis`)
- Use PascalCase components for JSX-returning helpers; keep lowercase helpers for non-JSX values (`structure-component-naming`)
- Derive props/params instead of accepting a value computable from another arg (`structure-derive-dont-duplicate`)
- Extract complex derived logic into named locals plus predicates or pure helpers with early returns: oversized conditions, nested ternaries, ternaries that compute instead of picking (multi-line branches, or an `as` cast re-asserting what the condition tested), fallback chains, and `let`-based render prep are code smells, in render prep and in hook options, request builders, config maps, and reducers alike (`structure-complex-derived-logic`)
- Pick the view with early `if` guards but keep the layout wrapper in one place — branch a body component, don't ternary or duplicate the shell (`structure-early-return-render-branches`)
- For a fixed set of items, write one component per item with explicit props that owns its data and loading — don't map a config-object array onto a component shape (`structure-composition-over-config`)

**Testing:**

- BDD tests that drive the real `@mastra/client-js` + React Query stack and mock only the network; never `vi.mock` our own hooks/services/auth gating or the SDK (`testing-bdd-no-mocks`)
- Avoid class-name assertions for visual behavior; prefer computed styles, user-visible behavior, or browser validation, and prefer no test over a className-only implementation mirror (`testing-no-classname-assertions`)

**Type Safety:**

- No `as` type assertions anywhere — production **or tests**; narrow with real type guards, query generics (`querySelector<T>`, `getByRole<T>`), typed fixture factories, or `implements` on mocks. `as const` is the only allowed form. Do not replace a cast with a domain-type predicate that only checks `typeof value === 'object'`; call that an `isRecord` helper or validate the fields used (`types-no-type-assertions`)
- Use `undefined` and optional `?` for absence, not `null`; convert external `null` at boundaries, and keep leaf props strict so callers own absence and fallback rendering (`types-no-null`)

### Rendering Patterns

- Animate SVG wrappers, not SVG elements directly (`rendering-animate-svg-wrapper`)
- Use `content-visibility: auto` for long lists (`rendering-content-visibility`)

### JavaScript Patterns

- Use Set/Map for repeated lookups (`js-set-map-lookups`)
- Use `toSorted()` instead of `sort()` for immutability (`js-tosorted-immutable`)
- Early length check for array comparisons (`js-length-check-first`)

Rule files are the canonical source for detailed guidance and examples:

- `references/react-best-practices-reference.md` - Rule catalog with category order and rule-file paths
- `references/rules/` - Canonical individual rule files organized by category

Load only the relevant rule file when implementing or reviewing a specific pattern. Use the catalog to choose the right rule without loading every example.

To look up a specific pattern, grep the rules directory:

grep -l "barrel" references/rules/
grep -l "Tanstack" references/rules/
```
