## No `as` Type Assertions (Including Tests)

Never use `as` type assertions (`x as T`, `x as unknown as T`, `x as any`). They tell
the compiler to stop checking, so a wrong shape passes silently until it breaks at
runtime. This applies **in tests too** — test fixtures and DOM lookups are exactly
where a silent shape drift goes unnoticed. `as const` is fine (it narrows, it does
not assert a type).

**Why this matters:**

- An `as` cast is an unchecked claim; refactors that change the real type won't flag the cast site.
- Test casts (`getByX(...) as HTMLInputElement`, `{...} as SomeMessage`) hide fixture drift and make tests assert against a shape the code no longer produces.
- Every cast is a place a `null`, a missing field, or a wrong union member can slip through.
- A weak type predicate can be the same problem under a better name: `typeof value === 'object' && value !== null` proves record-ness, not that `value is DomainType`.

**Use instead:**

- **Type guards** with a predicate return (`value is T`) to narrow `unknown`/loose values. The guard must prove the fields or discriminants the code uses; otherwise name it as a broad helper such as `isRecord`.
- **Generic type arguments** on APIs that accept them (`querySelector<HTMLElement>(…)`, `screen.getByRole<HTMLTextAreaElement>(…)`, `closest<HTMLFormElement>(…)`).
- **Typed factories / annotated locals** for fixtures, so the object is checked against the target type.
- **`implements`** on class mocks so the instance genuinely satisfies the interface.
- **`satisfies`** when you want inference kept but the value validated against a type.

**Incorrect:**

```ts
// Production: silences a real union/shape mismatch
const metadata = message.content.metadata as MessageMetadata | undefined;
return { ...message, role: 'assistant', content } as MastraDBMessage;

// Tests: fixture and DOM casts hide drift
const msg = { id, role: 'signal', content } as MastraDBMessage;
const textarea = screen.getByPlaceholderText('Message') as HTMLTextAreaElement;
const el = document.querySelector('[data-x]') as HTMLElement;
this.callback(entries as IntersectionObserverEntry[], this as unknown as IntersectionObserver);

// Fake guard: this only proves "non-null object", not MessageMetadata.
const isMessageMetadata = (value: unknown): value is MessageMetadata => typeof value === 'object' && value !== null;
```

**Correct:**

```ts
// Production: narrow with a guard, or annotate the built object
const isRecord = (value: unknown): value is Record<string, unknown> =>
  typeof value === 'object' && value !== null && !Array.isArray(value);

const isMessageMetadata = (value: unknown): value is MessageMetadata => {
  if (!isRecord(value)) return false;

  const custom = value.custom;
  if (custom !== undefined && !isRecord(custom)) return false;

  const modelMetadata = custom?.modelMetadata;
  if (modelMetadata !== undefined && !isRecord(modelMetadata)) return false;

  return true;
};

const metadata = isMessageMetadata(message.content.metadata) ? message.content.metadata : undefined;
const parts: MastraDBMessage['content']['parts'] = [{ type: 'data-signal', data }];
return { ...message, role: 'assistant', content: { ...message.content, parts } };

// Tests: typed factory, query generics, guards, and `implements`
const signalMessage = (id: string, type: string): MastraDBMessage => ({
  id,
  role: 'signal',
  type,
  createdAt: new Date(),
  content: { format: 2, parts: [] },
});
const textarea = screen.getByPlaceholderText<HTMLTextAreaElement>('Message');
const el = document.querySelector<HTMLElement>('[data-x]');
if (!el) throw new Error('missing element');
class MockIO implements IntersectionObserver {
  /* real members */
}
```

**Reviewer smell:** any `as` in a diff (except `as const`), or a domain-type
predicate whose body only checks `typeof value === 'object' && value !== null`.
A cast in a test is not a shortcut — it is the same defect as a cast in
production, in the one place no one looks.

Casts clustered inside a conditional usually mean a missing predicate.
`typeof value === 'object'` narrows `unknown` to `object | null`, and a non-null
check only leaves `object` — a type with no properties — so every read still
needs an assertion; and because narrowing tracks
references rather than expressions, a condition written over `(value as X).y`
leaves the branch to assert again. Write the predicate — `isRecord`, or one that
proves the fields used — and the cluster disappears. If the conditional is dense
as well, extracting it is a separate repair
(`structure-complex-derived-logic`).
